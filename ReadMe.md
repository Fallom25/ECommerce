# ECommerce Project for _Nology

## Project Description
The aim of this project was to build a basic E-commerce Site combining multiple pages of HTML together.

## How to Install and Run
I use the VSCode extension LiveServer to run my HTML websites locally.

## How to use
There is not official function of this website as it is just a demo. However, all links should navigate you around the website / to the correct email and facebook information. The Cart will add remove items on the local storage.

## Outline of my Solution
The design website is based off a weebly built website for the same business plus comments from the business owner. 
This website was made using HTML, CSS and JS. I also used the preprocessor Sass and the component Library Bootstrap. As well as icons from FontAwesome.
The basic JS for this website uses DOM manipulation and event handling to add and remove items from the cart, this was based off a youtube tut referenced below.

## Considerations and Further Growth
Currently there is no testing built for this entire project that is something I would want to implement. 

I am also in the process of rebuilding this project using the ReactJS framework and Material UI as the component library. 

In future I would like to host this website, remove the cart function and have the Book an appointment function send an email or text to the business owner.

## Personal Comments
This is a personal project as this is a real business that a close friend runs. I would like to have this website fully work for him and personalize it more than his current pre-built website.
